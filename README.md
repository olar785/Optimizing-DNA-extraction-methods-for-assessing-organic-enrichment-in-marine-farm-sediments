# Optimizing-DNA-extraction-methods-for-assessing-organic-enrichment-in-marine-farm-sediments
Project objective: eDNA metabarcoding workflow optimization
Investigating the effect of DNA extraction kits and sediment quantities on prokaryotic and eukaryotic assemblages along an organic enrichment gradient adjacent to fish farms. 

This repository contains the bioinformatics script used for demultiplexing 16S and 18S rRNA paired-end raw sequences, and for quality filtering, denoising and chimera filtering using DADA2 implemented in Qiime2.
